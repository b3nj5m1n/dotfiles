# (Neo) Mutt

I have replaced all occurences of my real email addresses in these files.

I don't use a public github repo to sync these files, so what you're seeing might be out of date.

I use neomutt, isync and msmtp with multiple accounts. The original config was generated by [mutt wizard](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard), I have modified some of the important parts, for example I use my full email adress in filesnames and such, and the list of my mailboxes is dynamically generated, meaning if I have a new folder on my remote email account, it is automatically added to mutt after being synced by isync.
