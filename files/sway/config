# SUPER key as mod. I've used ALT for like 2 years now because I initially
# thought it was a good idea, but it really, really isn't. Many other programs,
# for example firefox, use the alt key for stuff of varying importance. (In
# firefox, you can use it to quickly get to another tab, for example ALT+2 will
# get you to the second tab)
# Many programs, pretty much all the electron apps for example, open their menu
# at the top when you press alt, or, more specifically, when you release alt.
# This means that when you press ALT+2 to switch to your second workspace with
# firefox on it, and once you're there you let go of the alt key, the menu will
# open up. This is an issue, for example it unfocuses text fields. Say you're
# taking your daily notes in logseq, you switch to your firefox workspace to
# copy some text, go back to your logseq workspace, logseq opens up its menu at
# the top and you now have first press alt to get out of the menu again, then
# click to get back to entering text.
# Choosing ALT was a bad decision, but thankfully it seems like switching back
# isn't going to require as much work as I had thought.
