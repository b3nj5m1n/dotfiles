;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
(setq user-full-name "Benjamin"
      user-mail-address "b3nj4m1n@gmx.net")

;; Exit insert mode
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'evil-normal-state)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-c C-c") 'evil-normal-state)
;; Paste with Control + Shift + v in insert mode
(define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-S-v") 'evil-paste-after)


;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/.local/share/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)

;; Use super as meta key
(setq x-super-keysym 'meta)


;; Configure org
(after! org
  (setq org-directory "~/.local/share/org/")
  (require 'org-bullets)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))
  (setq org-agenda-files '("~/.local/share/org/"))
  (setq org-default-notes-file (expand-file-name "notes.org" org-directory))
  (setq org-ellipsis " â–¼ ")
  (setq org-log-done 'time)
  (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t)
  (setq org-journal-dir "~/.local/share/org/")
  (setq org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y")
  (setq org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
  )


;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

;; Spellcheck config
(with-eval-after-load "ispell"
  ;; Configure `LANG`, otherwise ispell.el cannot find a 'default
  ;; dictionary' even though multiple dictionaries will be configured
  ;; in next line.
  (setenv "LANG" "en_GB")
  (setq ispell-program-name "hunspell")
  ;; Configure German, Swiss German, and two variants of English.
  (setq ispell-dictionary "de_DE,en_GB")
  ;; ispell-set-spellchecker-params has to be called
  ;; before ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic will work
  (ispell-set-spellchecker-params)
  (ispell-hunspell-add-multi-dic "de_DE,en_GB")
  ;; For saving words to the personal dictionary, don't infer it from
  ;; the locale, otherwise it would save to ~/.hunspell_de_DE.
  (setq ispell-personal-dictionary "~/.local/share/dictionary/hunspell_personal"))
;; Enable flyspell everywhere
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)

;; The personal dictionary file has to exist, otherwise hunspell will
;; silently not use it.
                                        ; (unless (file-exists-p ispell-personal-dictionary)
                                        ;   (write-region "" nil ispell-personal-dictionary nil 0))


;; Completion config
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.1
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
  (add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
